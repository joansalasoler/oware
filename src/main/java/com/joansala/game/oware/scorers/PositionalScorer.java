/**
 * Evaluate the current state of an Oware game using a material and
 * positional heuristic.
 *
 * This positional heuristic goes beyond simply counting captured seeds
 * and considers the arrangement of seeds on the board. This includes:
 *
 * - Material advantage (captured seeds)
 * - Attack potential (houses with many seeds)
 * - Defensive potential (houses that can be captured)
 * - Mobility (how many moves a player has in hand)
 *
 * This evaluation heuristic, which turns out to be quite good, was
 * created using a simple linear regression method, by analyzing
 * randomly generated game states to identify key factors that improve
 * the accuracy of the {@link MaterialScorer} heuristic.
 *
 * Here's the method that was used to derive this function:
 *
 * 1. Generate a set of random game states that are not final.
 * 2. For each position, evaluate it using an engine ({@link Negamax},
 *    {@link UCT}) and the {@link MaterialScorer} heuristic (number of
 *    seeds captured by south minus the number of north captures).
 * 3. Instead of a fixed depth or spending a long time evaluating each
 *    position, we evaluate each position for a short time (100ms).
 * 4. For each position, choose a set of features that may be suitable
 *    to finetune the {@link MaterialScorer} heuristic. For Oware Some
 *    good clues are the number of seeds in each house and on the stores.
 * 5. Remove from the training set all the positions that were evaluated
 *    with an exact score ({@code Â±MAX_SCORE}). We want to predict the
 *    material advantage (piece difference) rather than the game outcome.
 * 6. To create a symmetrical evaluation function, augment the training
 *    set with the mirrored version of each position, where the features
 *    are reversed and the scores are negated.
 * 7. Use linear regression to figure out how much weight each feature
 *    should have to improve the accuracy of the {@link MaterialScorer}
 *    heuristic. Some features might not be helpful at all, while others
 *    might be better combined.
 * 8. Once we find the important features, we'll adjust their influence
 *    to make them balanced. Imagine a feature that gets a score of W
 *    (positive) for a player. This same feature should get a score of
 *    -W (negative) for their opponent, to reflect the opposite effect.
 * 9. The final heuristic is the sum of the products of the minimal set
 *    of features we found and their respective weights. Ensure the
 *    heuristic scores are always between {@code +MAX_SCORE} and
 *    {@code -MAX_SCORE} (exclusive) by adjusting the weights.
 *
 * The provided {@code suite} command line tools can be used to create
 * the training set. The Weka machine learning toolkit can be used
 * for the linear regession (https://ml.cms.waikato.ac.nz/weka).
